and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Cursor IDE integration** (`hedwig-cg cursor install/uninstall`): Creates `.cursor/rules/hedwig-cg.mdc` with alwaysApply rules
- **Windsurf IDE integration** (`hedwig-cg windsurf install/uninstall`): Creates `.windsurf/rules/hedwig-cg.md` for Cascade
- **Cline (VS Code extension) integration** as 8th supported AI agent
- **`hedwig-cg doctor` command**: 21-point installation health check (Python version, deps, tree-sitter parsers, MCP, embedding models, DB integrity, FAISS indexes)
- **MCP tool descriptions optimized for AI agents**: `search` marked as PRIMARY tool, `communities` marked as "rarely needed", `instructions` guide agents to start with search
- **AI Agent Interface Design Principle** documented in CLAUDE.md: minimal interface philosophy to prevent hallucination
- **Weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion**: Per-signal weights (code_vec=1.0, text_vec=1.0, graph=0.8, keyword=1.5, community=0.7) tuned for optimal search quality
- **Stopword filtering**: 80+ common English stopwords removed from keyword/community search terms for improved FTS5 precision
- **LRU search result cache** (128 entries): Instant return for repeated queries, auto-cleared on graph rebuild
- **Query embedding LRU cache** (256 entries): Eliminates re-encoding for identical queries (291ms → 0ms)
- `extract_search_terms()` public API for reusable stopword-filtered term extraction
- `clear_search_cache()` and `clear_query_cache()` public APIs
- `weights` parameter on `hybrid_search()` for runtime signal weight tuning
- **Weight-aware graph expansion**: BFS traversal now uses edge weights (semantic similarity + confidence + proximity) and relation-type weights (`calls`/`inherits`=1.0, `imports`=0.7, `defines`=0.5, `contains`=0.3) instead of uniform hop distance
- `RELATION_WEIGHTS` dictionary for configurable per-relation expansion priority
- **Parent class context in embeddings**: Method/constructor/property nodes now include "method of ClassName" in embedding text for better class-membership queries
- **Query-relevant snippets**: Search results now show the most query-term-dense region of source code instead of blind truncation from the start
- **MCP Server** (`hedwig-cg mcp`): Model Context Protocol server exposing 5 tools (search, node, stats, communities, build) over stdio transport for universal AI agent integration
- **Search signal explainability**: Each result now includes per-signal RRF contribution breakdown (code_vector, text_vector, graph, keyword, community) in CLI table and MCP output
- **JS/TS call graph extraction**: Tree-sitter now extracts function/method calls in JavaScript and TypeScript (previously only Python had call tracking), with JS builtin filtering
- **Pipeline stage timing**: Build command now displays per-stage wall-clock timing breakdown (detect, extract, build, pagerank, embed, cluster, analyze, store) with total elapsed time
- **Incremental embedding**: `--incremental` builds now skip re-embedding unchanged nodes by checking existing embeddings in DB, reducing rebuild time by up to 95% (8.7s → 0.4s when no files changed)
- **Fast search mode**: `--fast` flag uses text model only, skipping code model loading for lower cold-start latency; available in CLI, REPL, and MCP server
- **REPL model preloading**: `hedwig-cg query` REPL now preloads embedding models in a background thread so first search is faster
- **Python decorator extraction**: Decorators (`@dataclass`, `@cli.command()`, `@staticmethod`, etc.) are now extracted and stored as node attributes, enriching embeddings for decorator-aware search
- **Search result line numbers**: Results now include `start_line`/`end_line` in CLI (`file.py:42`), MCP server (`file.py:42-67`), and SearchResult API — enabling AI agents to navigate directly to code

### Changed
- README updated with real benchmarks (9.5s full build, 0.4s incremental, 0.08s warm search), new features (fast search, line numbers, decorator extraction, incremental embedding), and revised optimizations list
- FAISS index loading now uses `IO_FLAG_MMAP` for lower RSS and faster cold starts on large indices (with automatic fallback)
- Pipeline automatically clears search result and query embedding caches after rebuild
- RRF keyword weight boosted from 1.0 → 1.5 so exact-match code entities rank higher
- Graph expansion seeds increased from top-5 to top-8 for broader graph signal coverage

### Fixed
- **CI failure**: Added `mcp>=1.0` to dev dependencies and `pytest.importorskip("mcp")` guard for graceful skip
- **MCP stats tool**: Fixed `compute_god_nodes` (non-existent) → `analyze()` from analyze module returning `AnalysisResult.god_nodes`
- **Fast mode variable shadowing**: `code_vector_hits` was incorrectly overwritten with text-model results

### Performance
- Search performance improved ~46% (5.9s → 3.2s) via FAISS disk persistence and graph expansion caching
- Query embedding cache hit: 291ms → 0ms (3M+ speedup for repeated queries)
- FAISS mmap loading reduces memory footprint for large indices
- Warm search: 0.02s, cached search: 0.006s (986 nodes / 2091 edges)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Chinese (简体中文) README** (`docs/README_zh.md`)
- **German (Deutsch) README** (`docs/README_de.md`)
- Cross-language navigation links across all 5 README variants (en, ko, ja, zh, de)

### Fixed
- Correct HybridRAG signal count from "6-signal" to "5-signal" across all documentation, code comments, and CLAUDE.md (actual RRF receives 5 ranked lists: code vector, text vector, graph, keyword, community)
- Clarify `hedwig-cg search` as the single primary HybridRAG entry point in skill rules and PreToolUse hook

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Community-aware HybridRAG**: 5-signal search (code vector + text vector + graph + keyword + community)
- **Community summaries**: Auto-generated keyword-rich text from node labels, kinds, docstrings, and file paths
- **`hedwig-cg communities` CLI command**: List, filter by level, and search communities
- **Markdown document extraction**: Headings become section nodes with hierarchy, internal links become reference edges
- **Incremental build** (`--incremental`): SHA-256 content hashing skips unchanged files for fast rebuilds
- **Embedding download UX**: Rich console message on first model download (~80MB)
- `community_search()` method in KnowledgeStore for summary-based community lookup
- **D3.js export format** (`--format d3`): Force-directed graph JSON with PageRank-based sizing and kind-based grouping
- **`hedwig-cg visualize` CLI command**: Self-contained interactive HTML visualization with zoom, search, tooltips, and drag
- **`hedwig-cg clean` CLI command**: Remove .hedwig-cg/ database directory with confirmation prompt
- **Graph quality metrics in `stats`**: Density, connected components, average clustering coefficient
- Comprehensive CLI command tests (communities, search, d3 export, visualize, clean)
- Comprehensive JavaScript tree-sitter extraction tests (17 tests)
- **`hedwig-cg query` REPL**: Interactive search session with `:node`, `:stats`, `:quit` commands
- **`--offline` flag for `visualize`**: Inlines D3.js (~280KB) for airgapped/offline environments
- **TypeScript-specific extraction**: Interfaces (with extends/method signatures), type aliases, enums with member extraction
- E2E integration tests for full pipeline (build → store → search → incremental → export → clean)
- TypeScript-specific tree-sitter extraction tests (12 tests)
- 160 tests with 87% code coverage (up from 61 tests)
- **PyPI classifiers expansion**: Python 3.10/3.11/3.12, AI/NLP topics, `Typing :: Typed`, OS Independent
- **GitHub Actions PyPI publish**: Automated deployment on GitHub Release via `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`

### Fixed
- **Critical**: `dependencies` in pyproject.toml was under `[project.urls]` TOML section, causing wheel to declare zero dependencies
- Resolved all 27 ruff lint errors (import sorting, unused variables, line length)
- Removed legacy ignore-file backward compatibility reference
- Removed stale `build_hnsw_index` backward-compat alias from store.py
- Fixed `try_to_load_from_cache` return value check in embeddings.py (operator precedence bug)
- **Critical**: Incremental build second run returned empty graph — fixed by merging unchanged files from DB via `nx.compose()`

### Changed
- Updated CLAUDE.md and Claude Code skill docs with new commands and features
- Updated CHANGELOG.md to reflect all iterations
